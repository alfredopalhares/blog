title : Blogging with jekyll
---

I have never been a blogger and the idea of having a bloated cms with a complicated server side code struture and even more unecessary database just to display static text that noone is not gona comment never pleased me much.

Other option was to use static html, but that is so hard to maintain that is ridiculous. But then i found 
[jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (angels singing in the background) that is a blogging engine that allows me to blog in a simple [mardown syntax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) form my favorite editor, [vim](http://www.vim.org/). Well just this was a good motive to try it out. 

{% highlight bash %}
while true;
  do
    echo "test of the highlight";
  done
{% endhighlight %}
