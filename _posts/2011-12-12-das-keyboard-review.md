title: Das Keyboard Review
---

For those who doesn't know, the das keyboard is a [mechanical-switch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_technology#Mechanical-switch_keyboard) type 
of keyboard that uses [real switches](http://www.cherrycorp.com/english/switches/key/mx.htm) under each key, in this particular keyboard the response 
and travel time is very low and allows up to 6 [keys rollover](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollover_(key) (or unlimited with the ps2 adapter), 
which makes it great for fast typing. 

The building quality is outstanding, the keys feel very sturdy and for sure can take a big abuse over the years, I've only had it for 6 months 
using it every day for about 10 hours and it feels just like when i bought, most start to hear out over 2 months ( talking about 
[dome-switch keyboards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiclet_keyboard) which are the most common nowadays). Its quite heavy,
so its not very easy to transport around, but it also improves the sturdy feel when typing on the desk and less likely to slide.

The most "stand-out" feature is the sounds that makes when clicking. Its a very solid sturdy "clack" sound. 
Depending on the person you either love it or hate it, personally i find it quite "therapeutic", 
your colleagues may not think the same way, just offer them some [earplugs](http://store.daskeyboard.com/Reusable-Earplugs/dp/B003ALN3QE).
However if you don't like the sound you can also buy the [silent](http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-professional-silent/) version 
that i did not tried personally, but das claims it has the same feel and is alot more silent. Or you can learn not to press the
keys all the way down not generating the so loud "clack" sound.

Another killer option, is the labeless version (both for the [clicky](http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-ultimate/) and 
[silent](http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-ultimate-silent/)), which i bought for too reasons: 1) it looks bad ass on my
old style dark wooden desk 2) I wanted to test on many times i looked to the keys unconsciously, tough i consider myself
a quite decent typist, i found my self looking at the keys when i thank i wasn't. In one week i didn't look to my keyboard
anymore, my mechanical memory and typing speed improved both a little bit, so that's some bonus points.

A neat extra is the 2 USB ports that comes o right side of the keyboard, its handy to copy some files to that USB flash drive
that i always carry on my pocket. This being said it uses 2 cables (one for the keyboard, another for the hub), the connectors
are labeled if only want to use the keyboard. The cable also is a good 2 meter long, i personally like because i have a quite
big desk. I also give a plus for the [cool acessories](http://store.daskeyboard.com/b/2258669011) such as colorful keys for the gamers
and tux penguin windows key replacer.

The price starts around 100 euros, which is alot for a keyboard, but if you're a heavy typer and use the computer for long periods of time
you will enjoy the das keyboard, on the long term it may save on durability. 

At end of the day if you have the money and you like to geek out, it worth's it.
